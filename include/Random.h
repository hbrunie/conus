     * @brief Base class for all the various Deviates.
     *
     * This holds the essential random number generator that all the other classes use.
     *
     * All deviates have three constructors that define different ways of setting up
     * the random number generator.
     *
     * 1) Only the arguments particular to the derived class (e.g. mean and sigma for
     *    GaussianDeviate).  In this case, a new random number generator is created and
     *    it is seeded using the computer's microsecond counter.
     *
     * 2) Using a particular seed as the first argument to the constructor.
     *    This will also create a new random number generator, but seed it with the
     *    provided value.
     *
     * 3) Passing another BaseDeviate as the first arguemnt to the constructor.
     *    This will make the new Deviate share the same underlying random number generator
     *    with the other Deviate.  So you can make one Deviate (of any type), and seed
     *    it with a particular deterministic value.  Then if you pass that Deviate
     *    to any other one you make, they will all be using the same rng and have a
     *    particular deterministic series of values.  (It doesn't have to be the first
     *    one -- any one you've made later can also be used to seed a new one.)
     *
     * There is not much you can do with something that is only known to be a BaseDeviate
     * rather than one of the derived classes other than construct it and change the
     * seed, and use it as an argument to pass to other Deviate constructors.
